<h1>Farrokhian Philisophy: </h1>
<p>What is Farrokhian Philisophy: To summarise it is a Universal thought and Truthfulness (Asha), Emphasis on Objective Truth and Spiritual Introspection as well as Spiritual Insight and Introspection and cultavation of ones being (Soul and awareness). Of course it is a synthesis and covers, adds on, continues previous and currently existing Philisophical Traditions, Metaphysics, Religious traditions etc. We do not address nor have we choosen Farrokhi to be a Prophet nor will it benefit him but a servant of my will and a spiritual teacher, educator, philisopher and a holy one. Farrokhian Philosophy is the Philosophy and works of Kynan Farro also known as Ordinary Man or Farrokhi on Metaphysics, Spirituality, Universality, Dialogue, Treatises among any other thing that may come to your head. He builds on and continues the work of the philosophers, theologians and prophets before him with his understanding. He innovates, synetcises and adds new things on top of his forefathers. Like Neo Platonism, Judaism, Christanity, Islam, Babi, Bahai Faith, Buddhism, Socratic, Zoroastrian, Hindusm, Nihlism, Exentialism, Osho etc. We speak to thee in a Shakespearen Language with a royal we and divine language.

Oh Farrokhi isn't these people who hath read this in my Court or are they clueless for I am the reader of minds and writer of destinies. For we judge all who read my words and look open my servant. -Kynan Farro
